# Consumer and Retail Industry

## What is a consumer industry?
In simplified terms, the consumer industry is one that produce goods for direct use by consumers, that means the products of this industry can be directly used by consumers, for eg, toothpaste, paper, textiles, etc as opposed to the capital goods industry, which manufactures goods for sale to other companies.

## What retail industry means?
Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers.

The Consumer & Retail industry covers businesses that produce, distribute, and sell goods and services directly to end consumers. It includes consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, retailers (online & offline), food & beverage, fashion, personal care, and household products.
