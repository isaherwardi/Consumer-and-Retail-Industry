# Innovation in Consumer and Retail Industry

Consumer product companies face ongoing challenges from slowing industry growth to declining brand loyalty and the rise of unconventional competitors. Companies that innovate beyond product, design for consumer behaviour, and develop systemic capabilities to drive their innovation activities are likely to surpass competitors. Companies that maintain the status quo may continue to experience a negative impact.

## Strong consumer products innovation portfolios and capabilities generate more value

The companies that drive disproportionate returns and performance from their innovation investments are companies that do three things well:

## Innovate beyond product: 
Use multiple types of consumer product innovation to improve profitability and consumer experience. Companies that apply multifaceted innovation to support product differentiation demonstrated a better hit rate for innovations launched in the market.

## Design for consumer behaviour: 
Break through consumer paralysis and stimulate trial and adoption by leveraging “on the ground” realities of consumer decision-making. Deeper understanding of consumers’ cognitive and behavioural tendencies can help companies heighten consumer engagement and prevent off-ramps to action.

## Develop systemic capabilities: 
Build robust organizational structures that enable repeated consumer product innovation performance. Companies that systematically consider innovation strategy and intentionally structure to support and fuel innovation with the right leadership, talent, and funding mechanisms, can more reliably design, launch, and scale innovations over time.

## 1. Sustainability
Consumers are becoming more conscious of climate change and its impact on the environment. Thus, they pay more attention to companies’ social activities and seek those that offer more responsible product choices. As sustainability comes to the forefront, companies not only address how they present and package their products but also what materials they use in their products. To meet consumer demand, more and more FMCG companies offer compostable, recyclable, and reusable packaging. Additionally, cruelty-free, vegan ingredients are on the rise not only in food but also in non-food items such as cosmetics and cleaning products

## 2. Customer Experience
With the demand for convenience increasing in the consumer sector, companies strive to significantly improve customer experiences. Start-ups employ Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) to make products more engaging and interactive. 3D videos and gamification attract and entertain customers while providing them with more information about the product. Further, investing in improving customer experiences builds trust and increases brand loyalty. To this end, more and more consumer companies are providing higher convenience with digital technologies.
## 3. Digitalization
Digitization is increasingly becoming a priority for consumer brands as customers interact with brands across multiple online and offline channels. Companies get access to valuable data from these sources, including various social media platforms, web, and mobile applications. Besides, it also allows brands to better engage with their customers and convert one-time buyers into repeat customers
## 4. e-Commerce
The share of sales coming from e-commerce is increasing exponentially. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has further shifted consumers’ shopping habits towards online channels. Brands are now building their online presence to boost their engagement with consumers. Social media also plays a significant role in the world of e-commerce as more items are sold via social platforms such as Instagram. To this end, businesses actively incorporate diverse media, leveraging mobile and headless commerce, to market their products.
## 5. Big Data & Analytics
Companies actively leverage big data to innovate and compete in the industry. As data is becoming more and more accessible with consumers shopping online, brands explore new ways to increase relationships with their customers and gain insights from their behaviour. Data analytics explores customer preferences and behaviour to provide companies with a deeper understanding of their purchase habits. Big data solutions allow brands to optimize communication with their customers and offer more personalized experiences.
## 6. Artificial Intelligence
AI-powered solutions, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are gaining popularity and creating opportunities for the consumer industry. For instance, voice-based systems support consumers round-the-clock to find products, in addition to recommendation engines that provide personalized product suggestions. By implementing AI-based solutions, companies provide an enhanced customer experience, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and retention.

## 7. Direct Distribution
More and more companies are leveraging direct distribution to increase customer loyalty and ensure growth. For example, manufacturers directly interact with their end customers through their own online and offline distribution channels. This increases their profit margin and offers consumers a direct channel to reach their favorite brands. This industry trend is closely associated with e-commerce growth as well as the penetration of smartphones and the internet.

## 8. Internet of Things
As IoT evolves, its applications gain popularity in the consumer sector. IoT devices are automated and affordable, enabling companies to employ them in brick-and-mortar stores, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities. One example of IoT device implementation is to provide targeted messaging to consumers while they are shopping. Another one is inventory management, both in stores and in warehouses, for which IoT is widely used. In combination with related emerging technologies, including ambient intelligence and smart objects, IoT creates new consumer interaction channels and revenue streams for consumer brands.

## 9. Blockchain
The competition within the consumer industry is increasing and brands invest in blockchain to gain a competitive edge. Smart contracts and blockchain traceability allow companies to understand their supply chain bottlenecks and make necessary interventions. It also increases transparency for consumers by allowing them to track the source of their purchases. Additionally, blockchain platforms offer cryptocurrencies and loyalty programs that allow consumers to collect, exchange, and redeem points, increasing customer engagement.
## 10. 3D Printing
Additive manufacturing and its applications create disruptive solutions for the consumer industry. The vast amount of waste generated by use-and-throw consumer products, from personal care to food packaging, prompts industry stakeholders to find sustainable alternatives. 3D printing allows consumer brands and manufacturers to design and develop products that use eco-friendly materials and reduce plastic use. To this end, companies leverage 3D printing for prototyping, designing, tooling, and scaling production in a sustainable manner. Further, food companies are able to offer extra nutritional value in their products by utilizing 3D food printing.
